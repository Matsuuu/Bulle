# Bulle

Bulle is a modern solution for mocking HTTP API's.

Bulle can be utilized to create mock API endpoints for development purposes or for general testing.

Bulle provides:

- A quick to use Mock API supporting all HTTP methods
- Customizable response codes and bodies
- Input validation

### Usage

Bulle can be installed through npm with

```bash
npm install -g bulle
```

#### Examples

##### Generic single route example

```bash
bulle -r ping '{"message": "pong"}'
```

##### Multiple routes example

```bash
# Use the -p flag to set the port of the Mock API
bulle -p 3000 \
# Set up routes with the -r flag
-r ping 200 '{"message": "pong"}' \
# The order of parameters doesn't matter
-r '{"message": "pong"}' 200 pong \
# You can also specify a HTTP method for the route
-r users GET 200 '[{"id": 1, "name": "Foo"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Bar"}]' \
-r users/1 GET 200 '{"id": 1, "name": "Foo"}' \
-r users/add POST 201 '{"success": true}' \
# For larger return values, you can point towards a file containing the JSON data you want to return
-r users/add-tiger-king POST 201 example-return-body.json \
# If you want to validate the input, you can specify the types of inputs you are expecting.
# A 422 is returned on a invalid input
-r users/add-with-validations 201 POST '{"success": true}' 'id=number;name=string'
```

_For multiple route setups, a runnable script is recommended. A configuration file is in the works_

Bulle will start a [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) HTTP server to serve the endpoints, and provide a CLI interface for monitoring requests.
